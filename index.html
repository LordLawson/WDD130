      <img src="image/vllkyt69fd2mmg3qg.jpg" alt= "NIGERIA LANDSCAPE">
  <p>Nigeria is a country located on the western coast of Africa. It boasts a diverse geography, with climates ranging from arid to humid equatorial. What truly sets Nigeria apart, though, is its people. Hundreds of languages are spoken in the country, including Yoruba, Igbo, Fula, Hausa, Edo, Ibibio, Tiv, and English1. The national capital is Abuja, situated in the Federal Capital Territory, which was established by decree in 1976. While Lagos, the former capital, remains the leading commercial and industrial city in Nigeria. </p>
    <h4> ABOUT MY STATE</h4> 
  <p1>Certainly! Imo State (Igbo: »Æha Imo) is a state in the South-East geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It is bordered to the north by Anambra State, to the west and south by Rivers State, and to the east by Abia State1. The state takes its name from the Imo River, which flows along its eastern border. Here are some key points about Imo State:

        <h3> HELLO KNOW LITTLE WHERE I LIVE </h3>
        <img src="image/R.jpg"> <address> Owerri</address>

       <p> Capital: The state capital is Owerri.
        Population: Imo is the third smallest state in terms of area but ranks fourteenth in population, with an estimated population of over 5.4 million as of 20221.
        Geography: Geographically, Imo State is divided between the Niger Delta swamp forests in the far east and the drier Cross‚ÄìNiger transition forests in the rest of the state. Notable rivers include Awbana, Imo, Orashi, and Otamiri, along with the Oguta Lake in western Imo State1.
        Language and History: The state has been inhabited for almost a thousand years by the Igbo people, with Igbo serving as a lingua franca alongside English throughout the state. In the pre-colonial period, Imo was part of the medieval Kingdom of Nri and later the Aro Confederacy. After independence, it played a role in anti-colonial resistance during the Women‚Äôs War. During the Nigerian Civil War, Imo was part of the secessionist state of Biafra, with Owerri serving as the Biafran capital1.
        Imo State is often referred to as the ‚ÄúEastern Heartland‚Äù due to its strategic position and cultural significance </p>
